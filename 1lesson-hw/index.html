        <p class="family">The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
                Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and
                Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were
                created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart"
                for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were
                later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.</p>
